<p><em>Fun Fact: This resume is itself a coding project. Initially, it was written in Markdown. Next, it was converted to HTML using a VSCode extension. Next, it was stylized and converted into a PDF using a Python script and a CSS stylesheet. Finally, Git version control is used to manage the different versions of my resume I send to different employers.</em> (<a href="https://github.com/max-torch/My-Resume-Generator">View repository on GitHub</a>)</p>
