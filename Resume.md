## About Me

With a background in Electronics Engineering, I transitioned into the software and data industry because I can see myself continuing to grow due to the plethora of highly accessible online resources. I used the downtime of the Coronavirus pandemic to develop a strong foundation in software and data and have since been able to make improvements to my [favorite video game of all time](https://www.wesnoth.org/); work on internal dashboard app prototypes using Plotly Dash for a [social enterprise](https://www.includovate.com/); and, together with a team, build a [cross-platfrom mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/park-king-ph/id6450494343) from scratch using Flutter, Flask, and Firebase, until the app was released into production.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming and Markup Languages**: Python | SQL | Markdown | HTML/CSS | Dart/Flutter | Pug | Sass/SCSS | Javascript | Bootstrap
- **Python Libraries**: pandas | Plotly| Flask | Requests| Matplotlib | Seaborn | scikit-learn | Natural Language Toolkit | SciPy | NumPy | Beautiful Soup
- **Data-related Skills**: Importing Data from Various Sources | Interacting with REST and GraphQL APIs | Data Cleaning and Wrangling | Exploratory Data Analysis | Interactive and Static Data Visualization | Machine Learning | Dashboard Apps with Plotly Dash
- **DevOps Skills**: Docker | GitLab CI
- **Software Tools and Platforms**: Git | GitHub | GitLab | Visual Studio Code | Figma | Jupyter | Kaggle | Sphinx
- Experience with **Google Cloud**

## Work Experience

January 2023 - September 2023 | 9 Months | **Mapa Web Development** | Software Developer

- Collaborated closely with a fellow software developer, who was new to the role, to develop [a mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/park-king-ph/id6450494343) that allows users to book parking slots for events such as concerts and conferences. We utilized Flutter for the mobile client, Python Flask for the back end, used DragonPay for payment processing, Firebase for authentication, and Firestore for the database.
- Provided all the necessary requirements for successful acceptance and deployment of the app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store
- Orchestrated the setup of separate local, development, and production environments for controlled development and testing processes
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitLab and Docker for the back-end services, achieving high test code coverage and detailed documentation
- Managed Google Cloud infrastructure, ensuring cost efficiency, permissions, and security measures

April 2022 - July 2022 | 3 months | **Includovate** | System Engineer

- Established connections between low-level and high-level boards on Monday.com
- Created a Workload dashboard that provides visual information allowing you to determine which team members are under or overloaded.
  - Gets its data from Google Workspace, Google Calendar, and Monday.com and updates every time the page is refreshed.
  - Built using Plotly Dash,
  - Deployed on Google App Engine
  - Has access control using Google Identity-Aware Proxy

*Fun Fact: This resume is itself a coding project. Initially, it was written in Markdown. Next, it was converted to HTML using a VSCode extension. Next, it was stylized and converted into a PDF using a Python script and a CSS stylesheet. Finally, Git version control is used to manage the different versions of my resume I send to different employers.* ([View repository on GitHub](https://github.com/max-torch/My-Resume-Generator))
